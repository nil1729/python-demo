## Modules and Packages in Python (Using PyPi with pip install)

- PyPi is a Repository for open source third-party Python packages.
- It's similar to RubyGems in the Ruby world, PHP's Packagist, CPAN for Perl, and NPM for Node.js
- We've already only used libraries that come internally with Python
- We can use pip install at the command line to install these packages.
- Modules are just `.py` scripts that we call in another `.py` script.
- Packages are a collection of modules
